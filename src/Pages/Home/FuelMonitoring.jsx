          Truck telematics solution by Speedotrack is aimed on monitoring cargo
          status and performance of a freight truck and helps to improve fleet
          management system of a business. Truck telematics helps to reduce
          expenses on vehicle maintenance by using predictive maintenance
          approach – i.e. carrying out truck maintenance depending on real
          operation modes of engine, replacing fuel filters, tires and other
          consumable items when they are really actually worn out, rather than
          using schedule-based approach. Fuel tank calibration is essential in
          order to create an accurate fuel chart for each vehicle. A
          well-trained Speedotrack technician who is versed in the correct
          safety procedures will be dispatched to perform the fuel tank
          calibration.
