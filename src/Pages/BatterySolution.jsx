          The Speedotrack72V 30Ah portable battery pack is a compact, safe and
          economical lithium-ion battery pack. This standalone battery pack was
          designed for electric scooters, with high-power NMC lithium-ion cells.
          No additional equipment is needed for the safe operation of this
          battery pack. In extreme operating conditions, the integrated BMS
          disconnects the battery from the system. This ensures safe operation
          and protects the battery pack against short circuits, over-charge,
          over discharge, over current, over temperature and under temperature
          events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The integrated BMS passively balances the charge between all cells in
          the battery pack. Energy is discharged from the cells with the highest
          charge in the pack, which maximizes the runtime of the battery pack
          and extends its life. This lithium-ion battery pack is maintenance
          free, and has a longer run time with a shorter recovery time than
          equivalent lead acid battery packs. It weighs 70% less and takes up
          60% less space than equivalent lead acid battery packs, providing
          increased range and product compatibility.
