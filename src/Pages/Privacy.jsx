          services. You won&apos;t be entitled to a refund of the purchase price
          of your device, subject to your product warranty. If you have your
          device deactivated, there may be a charge to reactivate it if you
          later decide to use it again.

          for lawful purposes. Limits may be set on your level of use or tiered
          pricing may be applied based on your level or patterns of use. If you

          user. If you intend to transfer ownership of a vehicle in which a
          device is installed, you agree that you will have the device
          uninstalled from it or have the device and associated services

          to the transfer—of the fact your vehicle has your device and advise
          the transferee to contact us with any questions.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 7: Suspension and Termination of the Services</h2>
        <p>
          The services may be suspended or terminated without prior notice to
          you for good cause without liability. This means, to give some
          examples, that the services can be terminated or suspended if you
          breach any part of this agreement, do not pay amounts that are due
          under this agreement, interfere with provision of the services, or use
          the services for any illegal or otherwise improper purpose. The
          services may also be terminated or suspended if the availability of
          communication services used by us ends (for example, as a result of
          the discontinuance of service by a cellular telecommunications
          carrier) or is interrupted (for example, as a result of
          telephone/telecommunications network or internet congestion) or should
          any other circumstance arise or omission occur related to maintaining,
          repairing, or improving our network.

          If your vehicle is lost or stolen, we can try to help you locate it,
          although we have no responsibility to do so, do not guarantee that it
          can or will be found, and do not guarantee the condition of your
          vehicle or the items that were in it should the vehicle be recovered.
          You may be asked to provide satisfactory identification and/or a
          police report. In any event, our obligation to assist you in providing
          commercially reasonable assistance to your efforts to locate your
          vehicle will end after 48 hours have elapsed from the time it was
          first reported to the authorities as missing or stolen. Should we
          provide assistance after such 48-hour period, you agree that we may do
          so if and when we see fit and that we will not be held liable for any
          acts or omissions that may arise with regard to such assistance.
          Regardless of the circumstance, we will be under no obligation to help
          you locate your vehicle for the purpose of tracking or locating a
          person or recovering any valuables contained in your vehicle.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 10: Breach of this Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold us and our parent corporation,
          affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, agents, and service providers
          harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, causes
          of action, suits, proceedings, losses, damages, costs and expenses,
          including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, arising from or relating to
          your use of the services, breach of this agreement, or any act, error,
          or omission on your part or that of anyone who uses the services. This
          provision will continue to apply after the termination or cancellation
          of this agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 11: One Year Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          Your device is covered by 7 Days to 1 year full replacement warranty
          from the date you install based on product models. This includes
          protection from Lions Auto GPS&apos; s to check your device properly
          and replace if needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 12: limitations of the Services</h2>
        <p>
          The services use cellular or other wireless telecommunications
          networks in the country as well as the global positioning system
          (“GPS”) satellite network. The services are not available everywhere,
          particularly in remote areas, or at all times. Your vehicle has to
          have a properly functioning electrical system and adequately charged
          battery for the services to have any chance of working. The services
          may not work if your device is not properly installed by our
          authorized representative, not properly maintained, modified by any
          person other than our authorized representative, or combined with
          equipment, services, or software not expressly approved by us. Certain
          elements of the services, such as the ability to remotely unlock or
          disable your vehicle, may simply be incompatible with your
          vehicle&apos;s design. There are other problems beyond our control
          that may prevent us from providing the services to you at any given
          time, such as damage to your vehicle in an accident, abuse or neglect
          of your device, terrain (hills, mountains, dips, valleys), buildings,
          bridges, tunnels, weather, the design of your vehicle, defects
          (including hidden defects) in your vehicle, localized “gaps” in
          cellular telephone network coverage, cellular telephone network
          congestion, and interference with the satellite transmissions that
          help supply the GPS data used by us in providing the services.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 13: Important Limitations of our Liability</h2>
        <p>
          These limitations of liability constitute waivers of important legal
          rights. In that regard, you acknowledge that these limitations are
          integral to the pricing of the services, and that, were we or our
          service providers to assume any further liability other than as set
          forth herein, our prices for the services would necessarily be
          substantially higher. Unless prohibited by applicable law, you agree
          as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
          One, you expressly agree that operation and use of your device or the
          services is at your sole risk. Neither we nor our service providers
          shall have any liability resulting from, or in any way related to, the
          use of your device or the services. You agree that you will not in any
          way hold us or our service providers responsible for any selection or
          retention of, or the acts or omissions of, other parties in connection
          the services. You understand that you have no contractual relationship
          whatsoever with any of our service providers and are not a third party
          beneficiary of any agreement between us and our service providers,
          although they may be third party beneficiaries of this agreement. You
          waive any and all claims or demands you would have if you were a third
          party beneficiary of any agreement between us and our service
          providers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two, our and our service providers&apos; maximum, cumulative liability
          to you under any theory (including but not limited to fraud,
          misrepresentation, breach of contract, personal injury, or products
          liability) for any one or more related or unrelated claims is limited
          to an amount equal to three times what you paid for the services under
          this agreement as of the date of the earliest event giving rise to
          your claim(s).
        </p>

        <p>
          Three, you agree, and we agree, not to make, and to waive to the
          fullest allowed by law, any claims for (1) punitive damages, (2)
          treble, consequential, indirect, lost profits, incidental or special
          damages regardless of whether or not either party was advised of the
          possibility of such damages, or (3) attorney&apos;s fees. We both
          agree not to make, and to waive to the fullest extent allowed by law,
          any claim for damages other than direct, compensatory damages as
          limited in this agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Four, neither we nor our service providers are liable to you if the
          services are interrupted, or for problems caused by or contributed to
          by you, your vehicle (including its electrical system), by any third
          party, by buildings, hills, tunnels, telecommunications network
          congestion, weather, interference with satellite transmissions or any
          other things neither we nor our service providers control.
          Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, you agree to excuse
          any non-performance by us or our service providers caused in whole or
          in part by an act or omission of a third party, or by any equipment
          failure, act of god, natural disaster, strike, equipment or facility
          shortage, or other causes beyond our control or the control of our
          service providers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Five, neither we nor our service providers can promise that any data
          or information supplied will be error-free. All data and information
          is provided to you on an “as is” basis. You agree that neither we nor
          any service provider who monitors, processes, or sends or receives you
          data or information through your device or the services is liable for
          any errors, defects, problems, or mistakes in that data or
          information. This means you cannot recover any damages of any kind,
          including consequential (such as lost revenues or lost contracts),
          indirect, incidental, special, or punitive damages for those errors,
          defects, problems, or mistakes. The foregoing limitation of liability
          covers, without limitation, “angel services” whereby you communicate
          verbally with us or our service providers for special assistance in
          utilizing the services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Six, to provide you with the services, we must enter into agreements
          with telecommunications carriers operating cellular and satellite
          networks and other service providers using technology compatible with
          the particular device you purchased. Neither we nor our service
          providers are liable if the services become unavailable or are
          interrupted because a service provider terminates its agreement with
          us or stops providing service to us, or does anything that renders
          your device obsolete or incompatible with the technology used by us or
          any of our other service providers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seven, you agree that the limitations of liability and indemnities in
          this agreement will survive termination or expiration of this
          agreement and apply to you as well as anyone using your vehicle or the
          services, anyone making a claim on your behalf, and any claims made by
          anyone associated with you and arising out of or relating to the
          services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eight, the services are not a substitute for insurance. You promise
          that you will obtain and maintain appropriate insurance covering
          personal injury, loss of property, and other risks for yourself and
          for anyone else claiming under you. You hereby release and discharge
          us and our service providers from and against all hazards covered by
          your insurance. No insurance company or insurer will have any right of
          subrogation against us or our service providers.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 14: Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, and except as explicitly
          provided otherwise, this agreement and any disputes arising out of or
          relating to it will be governed by the laws of the people&apos;s
          republic of Bangladesh without regard to its conflict of law
          principles, and by any applicable tariffs, wherever filed. The UN
          Convention on contracts for the international sale of goods will not
          apply.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 15: Resolution of Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          If you have a disagreement with us related to the services, we will
          try to resolve it informally. If we cannot resolve it informally in a
          manner and time frame we reasonably deem appropriate, you agree, and
          we agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to use arbitration
          and not go through the courts (except smalls claims courts as provided
          below) with to resolve our disagreement. A government agency can
          always be contacted for help.
        </p>

        <h2>Article 16: Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          All intellectual property rights and any other proprietary rights
          inherent in, and appurtenant to, the device and the services are and
